Introduction to this site

So, there are many reasons for me to start this site. I may not even make this publish, so at the very least it's a way for my brain to masturbate for a change. To quote the Beastie Boys, "My noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts." For months, I've had a ton of thoughts that I want to share and this seems like an appropriate way to do it.

    Some make ask why I don't use Facebook or Twitter (since I use both of these) to get my thoughts out. Facebook could be fine except for a couple reasons. probably over 2/3 of the people I have on Facebook are family. I come from a very religious upbringing in a mostly religious family. Some of the things I want to talk about aren't exactly religion family. I'm planning on going into subjects like atheism, autism, sex, etc that I can't realisitally share with family. Of course, this will be in addition to conventional topics such as music, computers, maybe video games. But I don't want to have to only partially share what's in my head. It's very limiting and I don't want to be limited any more.

Another limitation of Facebook is even more extreme on Twitter...post length. I started using Twitter to have a space away from my family where I could explore these types of topics in peace, However, I'm not able to have longer posts to get my thoughts across. You can do multiple paragraphs in Facebook, but it's really not built for documents and essays. And Twitter, hoo boy! I think the limit there is about 45 characters each. I wouldn't even get a paragraph out before I have to keep replying myself. Mental masturbation, sure. But at some point you're just telling yourself the same joke over an over and it stops being funny. "Longer, longer, faster, faster." Um, yeah, sure. Ya know, I'll just be over here eating some cheetos. Even if telling yourself the same joke works once or twice, you're still going to already know the punchline hence it won't stay funny for long.

So, in the coming posts, expect some things about my home media network and archive and the technical steps in managing that. I'll probably have some posts about learing Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I'll talk about neurodiversity, in particular, Autism. I'm toying with the idea of starting an email signup for friends I let access this, but really, to what end? Forcing people to do it would be shitty, and how do I gatekeep to shield this from my family for the above reasons? Maybe instead of an email sign up, maybe use a commenting system like disqus. That sounds more likely. We shall see.

Lemme post this now so I have something.
